# Windows Shutdown Cheat Sheet

Windows provides several keyboard shortcuts to shutdown your system quickly. Here's a comprehensive guide to help you power down your computer efficiently.

## Basic Shutdown Shortcuts

| Keybinding | Action |
|------------|--------|
| `Alt + F4` (on desktop) | Opens shutdown dialog. Press `Enter` to confirm shutdown. |
| `Win + X`, then `U`, then `U` | Shutdown via Power User menu. |
| `Win + R`, type `shutdown /s /t 0`, press `Enter` | Immediate shutdown using Run command. |
| `Ctrl + Alt + Del`, then `Alt + U`, then `U` | Shutdown via security screen. |

## Alternative Shutdown Methods

| Keybinding | Action |
|------------|--------|
| `Win + X`, then `U`, then `R` | Restart your computer. |
| `Win + X`, then `U`, then `S` | Sleep your computer. |
| `Win + X`, then `U`, then `H` | Hibernate your computer. |
| `Win + L` | Lock your computer (not shutdown but useful). |

## Command Line Shutdown Options

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `shutdown /s /t 0` | Shutdown immediately. |
| `shutdown /r /t 0` | Restart immediately. |
| `shutdown /h` | Hibernate the computer. |
| `shutdown /s /t 60` | Shutdown after 60 seconds. |
| `shutdown /a` | Abort a scheduled shutdown. |

## Tips and Shortcuts

- **Desktop Focus:** For `Alt + F4` to open shutdown dialog, ensure no applications are in focus (click desktop first).  
- **Custom Shortcuts:** Create a desktop shortcut with target `shutdown /s /t 0` and assign a custom keyboard shortcut.  
- **Timer Shutdown:** Use `shutdown /s /t XXX` where XXX is seconds until shutdown (e.g., 3600 = 1 hour).  
- **Remote Shutdown:** Use `shutdown /s /m \\computername /t 0` to shutdown a remote computer.  
- **Force Shutdown:** Add `/f` to any shutdown command to force close applications (e.g., `shutdown /s /f /t 0`).  

## Emergency Shutdown

| Keybinding | Action |
|------------|--------|
| `Ctrl + Alt + Del`, then hold `Ctrl` and click power button | Force shutdown (use only when system is unresponsive). |
| Physical power button (hold 5+ seconds) | Force shutdown hardware-level (last resort). |
